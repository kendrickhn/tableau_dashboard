# Sales Performance Dashboard – Tableau

This project presents a Tableau dashboard analyzing sales performance data over a defined period, using insights from `performances.csv`. The dashboard was built as part of a guided project using Codecademy.

## Dataset
- **File:** `performances.csv`
- **Description:** Contains records of sales activity across different regions, products, and individual sales representatives.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
- **The Central region dominates** with **57% of total sales**.
- Sales performance started out **unstable**, but has shown a **steady increase in the last 4 months**.
- **Five sales reps are underperforming**, falling below the **median sales level**.
- **Two reps are significantly low** in performance and may need targeted support.
- **Binders** and **Pen Sets** are the **top-selling products**.
- **Desks** and **Binders** have the **highest selling prices**.
- Interestingly, **Desks** have the **highest price but the lowest sales volume**.

## Recommended Actions
- Underperforming sales reps should be guided to **focus on Binder sales**, given their strong volume and high pricing.
- The **Finance team** should further investigate **price-per-unit differences across regions** to identify pricing optimizations for weaker markets.
